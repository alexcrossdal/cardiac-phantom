# dynamic-cardiac-phantom

Python scripts to control dynamic cardiac phantom hardware.

These scripts were written as part of a summer research project under Dr. James Robar, Department of Radiation Oncology, NS Health Authority/Dalhousie University.

Two separate scripts were written to control hardware from two different manufacturers, then a third script was written to make a GUI and call the hardware scripts.  This makes the code modular and easy to work with/adapt to specific needs depending on what experiments are being carried out.
